# **PHAGESEEKER**
## *A novel tool for exploring phages in bacterial genomes.*

### **DISCLAIMER!**

The code for PhageSeeker was developed as part of a project carried out during the course of Microbial Metagenomics at the University of Padova. The project was supervised by Professor Stefano Campanaro and Dr. Esteban Orellana. The information, methodologies, and results presented in this project are based on research conducted by Paolo Marchi, Kathleen Araujo and Claudia Nomagugu Moyo.


### **INTRODUCTION**

Phages, (short for bacteriophages), are viruses that specifically infect and replicate within bacterial cells. They play a crucial role in shaping microbial ecosystems by controlling bacterial populations, transferring genetic material between bacteria, and influencing bacterial evolution. As interest in phage research continues to grow, the need for efficient tools to explore phages within bacterial genomes has become paramount. In this context, we present "PhageSeeker," an innovative tool designed to facilitate the identification and characterization of phages within bacterial genomes. With advances in DNA sequencing technologies, vast amounts of genomic data are being generated at an unprecedented rate. PhageSeeker leverages this wealth of genomic information to enable researchers, scientists, and bioinformaticians to effectively search for phages and study their genomic features. By comparing the genomic sequences to a comprehensive phage database, PhageSeeker can accurately detect and classify phages based on their genetic content and structural elements. The tool offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, enabling researchers to explore the discovered phages in depth.
